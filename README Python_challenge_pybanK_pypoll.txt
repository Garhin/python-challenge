* PythonChallenge-Pybank

* This project is to create a Python script for analyzing a set of financial records.
  The Python script will analyze the records to calculate each of the following.
 
* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of profit/losses over the entire period.

* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes.
